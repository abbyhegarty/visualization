This visualization comes from an article about Alaska’s Wildlife refuge and the ongoing debate to begin oil drilling in the protected area. The article specifically discusses the effects the effects a drilling project would have on the wildlife while telling a story of the author’s visit. In terms of expanding the island of knowledge, the visual does a sufficient job of giving an image that complements the text. What I liked about this image was the small area shaded dark green labeled “1002 Area”. It hadn’t been established in the article yet, but this is the area where the drilling could potentially be taking place. For me, at least, adding this area onto the visualization that appears early in the article expanded my shoreline of wonder because I wondered what it meant. Later this area plays a large part in the juxtaposition of the baby animals and the loss of land for them potential oil line would cause.

<li>It is truthful: For much of the information, the article cited the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. </li>
<li>It is functional: The map is easy to read. The smaller image in the lower left hand corner makes it easier to see where in Alaska the Refuge is located.</li>
<li>It is beautiful: The image is clean and simple.</li>
<li>It is insightful: Without this visualization, it would be difficult to know what the author is talking about when describing his journey unless you are familiar with Alaska.</li>
<li>The image is enlightening: The visualization helps to show how little land in Alaska already is protected. The introduction of the pipeline would create a slippery slope and lead to more shrinking if the refuge. </li>
